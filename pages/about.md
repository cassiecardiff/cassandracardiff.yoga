I'm an experienced yoga teacher with 1000+ teaching hours obtained in Canada, South Korea and the United Kingdom. Trained to teach Baptiste-Inspired Power Flow, Core Strength Vinyasa and Yoga For All, my classes emphasise alignment, accessibility, strength building and compassionate self-exploration. My focus is on adjusting postures and flows to meet the needs and body of the yoga practitioner - not the other way around.
